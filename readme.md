# Self-study Computer Science Progress Tracker

This repository contains my progress in self-studying computer science using online materials. Repository includes (but not limited to) lecture notes, exercise codes and projects. Majority of the course listed follows the curriculum from [Open Source Society University (OSSU)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).
