## Introduction

This project is a [tower defense](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tower_defense) game where the player acts as an ant queen that has to grow its colony to defense from bees attack. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' [Plants Vs. Zombies](https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies). Based on University of California Berkeley CS61A Spring 2018 Course [Project 3: Ants vs. SomeBees](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/proj/ants/).
