    "# Defining Functions\n",
    "At first, it was explained that this course is all about abstraction. In this section, we are going to learn tools for abstraction. Recall that abstraction is the process of:\n",
    "1. Take a complex thing\n",
    "2. Give it a name\n",
    "3. Treat it as a whole without worrying about its details\n",
    "\n",
    "`Assignment` is a simple means of abstraction as we can **bind names to values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Function definition` is a more powerful means of abstraction since we can bind names to not only values, but also **expressions** (e.g. series of statements).\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a function with the `def` keyword.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The first line, and the line between the `def` and `:`, is called `function signature`. `function signature` shows how many arguments a function takes in by listing the `<formal parameters>`. The `formal parameters` are `names` that refer to the argument values that are passed in into the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/signature.png)\n",

    "The `function body` defines what the function does. Below is a simple example of the body of a function, a return statement. The `<return expression>` is evaluated every time the function is called.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a procedure for evaluating `def` statements.\n",
    "#### Execution procedure for `def` statements:\n",
    "1. Every time there's a `def` statement, we create a new function. This function has a signature `<name>`(`<formal parameters>`)\n",
    "2. Set the body of that function to be **everything indented after the first line**\n",
    "3. Bind the `<name>` to that function we just created in the current frame\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: When we write the body of the function, Python **DOES NOT** execute it. When we defined the `square` function,"

    "## Looking Up Names in Environments\n",
    "We now know most of the story for user-defined function. But there's one more important piece that we have not covered: **looking up names in environments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every expression that Python evaluates is evaluated in the context of an environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Environments are the memory that keeps track of the correspondence between names and values. Thus, the environment knows what names are bound to what values. So far, the current environment is either:\n",
    "1. The global frame alond, or\n",
    "2. A local frame, followed by the global frame (Note the word \"followed\", indicates that there is an ordering)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2 very important things:\n",
    "1. An environment is a sequence of frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Recall that a frame is a binding between names and values (indicated by boxes in environmental diagrams)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. A name, when evaluated, evaluates to the value bound to that name in the earliest frame of the current environment in which that name is found\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if we want to look up the value bound to a name in an environment, we check each frame in turn. For example, to look up some `name` in the body of the `square` function,\n",
    "1. Look for the `name` in the local frame first. If it's found, then we obtain its value.\n",
    "2. If not found, look for it in the global frame.\n",
    "    * Built-in names like `max` are in the global frame too, but we don't show them in environment diagrams"
