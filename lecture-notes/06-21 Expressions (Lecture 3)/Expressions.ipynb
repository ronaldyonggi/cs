    "* If the 2 groups are similar in all ways except the **treatment**, a difference in the **outcome** is also evidence of **causality**\n",

    "* If the treatment and control groups have **systematic difference other than the treatment** itself, it might be difficult to identify a causal link\n",
    "* When these systematic differences lead researchers astray, they are called **confounding factors**\n",
    "* Such differences are often present in observational studies\n",
    "    * Observational study: the researcher **does not choose** which subjects receive the treatment\n",
    "    * Controlled experiment: the researcher **designs a procedure for selecting** the treatment and control groups\n",

    "### Randomize\n",
    "* When subjects are split up **randomly**, it's unlikely that there will be systematic differences between the groups\n",
    "    * And it's possible to account for the chance of a difference\n",
    "* Therefore, **randomized controlled experiments** are the most reliable way to establish causal relations"

Those steps are expressed through programs.\n",
