    "* Simplest setting: a **treatment** group and a **control** group\n",
    "* If the **outcome** differs between the 2 groups, then there's an `association` (or `relation`). \n",
    "    * E.g. the top-tier chocolate eaters died of heart disease at a lower rate (12%) than chocolate abstainers (17%)\n",
    "    * Because the % of people died of heart disease differ between the 2 groups, there was an `association`\n",

    "        * `association` is not `causality`!\n",
    "* To establish `causality`, we need an additional constrain on the 2 groups\n",
    "    * The 2 groups need to be similar in allways except the `treatment`\n",
