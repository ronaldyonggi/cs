    "# Deflategate (Chapter 12.2 in Inferential Thinking)\n",
    "On January 18, 2015, the Indianapolis Colts and the New England Patriots played the American Football Conference (AFC) championship game to determine which would play in the Super Bowl. After the game, there were allegations that the Patriots’ footballs had not been inflated as much as the regulations required; they were softer. This could be an advantage, as softer balls might be easier to catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several weeks, the world of American football was consumed by accusations, denials, theories, and suspicions: the press labeled the topic Deflategate, after the Watergate political scandal of the 1970’s. The National Football League (NFL) commissioned an independent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressure is often measured in pounds per square inch (psi). NFL rules stipulate that game balls must be inflated to have pressures in the range 12.5 - 13.5 psi. Each team plays with 12 balls. Teams have the responsibility of maintaining the pressure in their own footballs, but game officials inspect the balls. Before the start of the AFC game, all the Patriots’ balls were at about 12.5 psi. Most of the Colts’ balls were at about 13.0 psi. However, these pre-game data were not recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the second quarter, the Colts intercepted a Patriots ball. On the sidelines, they measured the pressure of the ball and determined that it was below the 12.5 psi threshold. Promptly, they informed officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "At half-time, all the game balls were collected for inspection. Two officials, Clete Blakeman and Dyrol Prioleau, measured the pressure in each of the balls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Patriots ball that had been intercepted by the Colts was not inspected at half-time. Nor were most of the Colts’ balls – the officials simply ran out of time and had to relinquish the balls for the start of second half play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, each row corresponds to one football. Pressure was measured in psi."

But we can make a chance model by hypothesizing that **the 11 Patriots’ drops look like a random sample of 11 out of all the 15 drops, with the Colts’ drops being the remaining four**. That’s a completely specified chance model under which we can simulate data. So it’s the null hypothesis.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Test Statistic\n",
    "A natural statistic is **the difference between the 2 average drops**, which is **average drops of Patriots - average drop of Colts**. Large value of the test statistic will favor the alternative hypothesis."
