    "\n",
    "One of the earliest example of astute observation eventually leading to establishment of causality is London back in 1850's. It was world's wealthiest city, but many of its people were desperately poor. Charles Dickens, an English writer, was writing about their plight (def: unfortunate situation, difficulty). Disease was rife (def: common occurrence) in the poorer parts of the city, with **cholera** being among the most feared. At that time, the concept of *germs* was not yet discovered, leading to the \"miasma\" theory.\n",

    "\n",
    "A doctor by the name John Snow had been following the cholera epidemic that hit England from time to time. Snow was skeptical of the miasma theory. He had noticed that while entire households were wiped out by cholera, the people in neighboring houses sometimes remained completely unaffected even though they were breathing the same air - or **miasmas** - as their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow also noticed that the onset of the disease almost always involved vomiting and diarrhea. Thus, he believed that the infection was carried by **something people ate or drank, not by the air that they breathed**. His prime suspect was water contaminated by sewage.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the deaths mounted, Snow recorded them diligently using a method that eventually became a standard in the study of how diseases spread: **drawing a map**. On a street map of the district, he recorded the location of each death.\n",

Even though the Rupert Street pump was closer, it was less convenient to get to because of dead ends and the layout of the streets. **The residents in those houses used the Broad Street pump instead**.\n",
    "* There were no deaths in 2 blocks just east of the pump. That was the location of the Lion Brewery, where the workers drank what they brewed. If they wanted water, the brewery had its own well\n",

    "* Treatment group = the people in S&V houses\n",
    "* Control group = the people in Lambeth houses\n",
    "A crucial element in Snow's analysis was that the people in the 2 groups were comparable to each other, apart from the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key to Establishing Casuality\n",
    "If the treatment and control groups are **similar apart from the treatment**, then differences between the outcomes in the 2 groups can be ascribed to the treatment. In order to establish whether it was the water supply that was causing cholera, Snow had to compare two groups that were similar to each other in all but one aspect: **their water supply**. Only then would he be able to ascribe (def: attribute something to) the differences in their outcomes to the water supply. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Trouble\n",
    "* If the treatment and the control groups have **systematic differences other than the treatment**, then it might be difficult to identify causality. \n",
    "* Such differences are often present in **observational studies**.\n",
    "* When they lead researchers astray, they are called **confounding factors**\n",
    "\n",
    "In John Snow's case, if the 2 groups had been different in some other ways as well, it would be difficult to identify that the water supply was the cause of the epidemic. For example, if the treatment group consisted of factory workers while the control group is not, then differences of the outcomes between the 2 groups could have been due to the water supply, or the factory work, or both, or to any other characteristic that made the 2 groups differ from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confounding\n",
    "\n",
    "In an observational study, if the treatment and control groups differ in ways other than the treatment, it will be more difficult to draw conclusions about causality.\n",
    "\n",
    "An underlying difference, other than the treatment, between the 2 groups is called a **confounding factor**, because it might confound you when you try to reach conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confounding Example: Coffee and Lung Cancer\n",
    "Studies in the 1960’s showed that coffee drinkers had higher rates of lung cancer than those who did not drink coffee. Because of this, some people identified coffee as a cause of lung cancer. But coffee does not cause lung cancer. The analysis contained a confounding factor – smoking. In those days, coffee drinkers were also likely to have been smokers, and smoking does cause lung cancer. Coffee drinking was associated with lung cancer, but it did not cause the disease.\n",

    "#### Example: Welfare subsidies in Mexico \n",
    "In Mexican villages in the 1990’s, children in poor families were often not enrolled in school. One of the reasons was that the older children could go to work and thus help support the family. Santiago Levy , a minister in Mexican Ministry of Finance, set out to investigate whether welfare programs could be used to increase school enrollment and improve health conditions. He conducted an RCT on a set of villages, selecting some of them at random to receive a new welfare program called PROGRESA. The program gave money to poor families if their children went to school regularly and the family used preventive health care. More money was given if the children were in secondary school than in primary school, to compensate for the children’s lost wages, and more money was given for girls attending school than for boys. The remaining villages did not get this treatment, and formed the control group. Because of the randomization, there were no confounding factors and it was possible to establish that PROGRESA increased school enrollment. For boys, the enrollment increased from 73% in the control group to 77% in the PROGRESA group. For girls, the increase was even greater, from 67% in the control group to almost 75% in the PROGRESA group. Due to the success of this experiment, the Mexican government supported the program under the new name OPORTUNIDADES, as an investment in a healthy and well educated population.\n",

    "For example, suppose you want to study the effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and you randomly assign some pregnant women to your “alcohol” group. You should not expect cooperation from them if you present them with a drink. In such situations you are more likely to conduct an observational study, not an experiment. Be alert for confounding factors."
