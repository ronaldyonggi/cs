    "# Project 3 - Classification\n",
    "Welcome to the third project of Data 8!  You will build a classifier that guesses whether a movie is romance or action, using only the numbers of times words appear in the movies's screenplay.  By the end of the project, you should know how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a k-nearest-neighbors classifier.\n",
    "2. Test a classifier on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm on Friday 11/30. You can earn an early submission bonus point by submitting your completed project by Thursday 11/29. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit, you must also **complete Part 1 of the project (out of 4) and submit it by 11:59pm on Friday 11/16**. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner; this partner **must** be enrolled in the same lab section as you are. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/fa18/staff.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Also, please be sure to not re-assign variables throughout the notebook! For example, if you use max_temperature in your answer to one question, do not reassign it later on.\n",

    "K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a classification algorithm.  Given some *attributes* (also called *features*) of an unseen example, it decides whether that example belongs to one or the other of two categories based on its similarity to previously seen examples. Predicting the category of an example is called *labeling*, and the predicted category is also called a *label*.\n",

The algorithm requires many previously seen examples for which both the attributes and labels are known: that's the `train_movies` table.\n",

    "## 2.1. Classifying a movie\n",
    "\n",
    "In k-NN, we classify a movie by finding the `k` movies in the *training set* that are most similar according to the features we choose. We call those movies with similar features the *nearest neighbors*.  The k-NN algorithm assigns the movie to the most common category among its `k` nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's limit ourselves to just 2 features for now, so we can plot each movie.  The features we will use are the proportions of the words \"money\" and \"feel\" in the movie.  Taking the movie \"Batman Returns\" (in the test set), 0.000502 of its words are \"money\" and 0.004016 are \"feel\". This movie appears in the test set, so let's imagine that we don't yet know its genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to make our notion of similarity more precise.  We will say that the *distance* between two movies is the straight-line distance between them when we plot their features in a scatter diagram. This distance is called the Euclidean (\"yoo-KLID-ee-un\") distance, whose formula is $\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the movie *Titanic* (in the training set), 0.0009768 of all the words in the movie are \"money\" and 0.0017094 are \"feel\".  Its distance from *Batman Returns* on this 2-word feature set is $\\sqrt{(0.000502 - 0.0009768)^2 + (0.004016 - 0.0017094)^2} \\approx 0.00235496$.  (If we included more or different features, the distance could be different.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A third movie, *The Avengers* (in the training set), is 0 \"money\" and 0.001115 \"feel\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The function below creates a plot to display the \"money\" and \"feel\" features of a test movie and some training movies. As you can see in the result, *Batman Returns* is more similar to *Titanic* than to *The Avengers* based on these features. However, we know that *Batman Returns* and *The Avengers* are both action movies, so intuitively we'd expect them to be more similar. Unfortunately, that isn't always the case. We'll discuss this more later."
