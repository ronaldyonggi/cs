    "# Designing Functions\n",
    "There are a lot of different functions that do the same thing. Some are better than others because they are easier for people to read and understand and they are more useful in more situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back then, people programmed without functions. They only had statements that told them to go to other statements. This whole thing was a mess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, we have functions. Functions are universally accepted as the right way to organize large programs. Thus, designing functions is an important skill for those who want to work in computer science."

    "3. The `behavior`:\n",

    "    * It returns the `nth` Fibonacci number\n",
    "    \n",
    "Python doesn't necessarily force us to specify the domain and range in code. These are conceptual aspects of what a function is meant to be used for. Often times, these characteristics are shown in the `documentation`. For example, with the `fib` function, we see `Compute the nth Fibonacci number, for N>=1`.  "
