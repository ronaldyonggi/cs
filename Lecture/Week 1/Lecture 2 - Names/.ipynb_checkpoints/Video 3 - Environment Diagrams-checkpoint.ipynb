    "# Environment Diagrams\n",
    "Environment diagram is a way to keep track of what's happening within the Python interpreter when it executes a program. Environments are the way in which an interpreter for a programming language keeps track of what names mean. We can think of it as a memory that keeps track of what names bound to what values. This involves drawing boxes and arrows, like what most computer scientists do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment diagrams visualize the interpreter's process. They look like the following,\n",
