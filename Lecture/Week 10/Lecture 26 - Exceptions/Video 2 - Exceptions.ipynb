    "Here are some tips for mastering exceptions:\n",
    "1. Exceptions are type of objects! They have classes with constructors.\n",
    "2. They are special because they enable non-local continuations of control\n",
    "    * Not to be mistaken with `nonlocal` statement. This is different!\n",
    "    \n",
    "The idea of non-local continuations of control is that if we have a chain of function calls (e.f. `f` calls `g` then `g` calls `h`):\n",
    "1. Normally what would happen is that `h` returns, then we continue executing the body of `g`. \n",
    "    * When `g` returns, that's when we go back to `f`\n",
    "    * Here, we finish returning from functions in the order that we called them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. However, exceptions can change the rule. Exceptions can shift control directly from `h` to `f`, bypassing `g` along the way. \n",
    "    * This means we can return to a different place than we would normally would. \n",
    "    * It's not exactly 'return'ing. It's raising an exception and handling it\n",
    "    \n",
    "When one statement is executed and the next one is executed, there may be functions that are separated by other functions in between. This is the definition of non-local continuations of control. \n",
    "\n",
    "Something to keep in mind is that exception handling tends to be slow. Thus, it's not something that we use for the standard approach to a program. This is only for non-standard situations. "
