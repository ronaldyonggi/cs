    "Functional programming is the idea that we can organize an entire program according to pure functions, which are modular and can be combined in an interesting way. \n",
    "\n",
    "In functional programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All functions are pure functions\n",
    "    * There's no side effect\n",
    "2. There's no re-assignment and no mutable data types\n",
    "    * When we create something, it says like that permanently\n",
    "3. Name-value bindings are permanent\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of functional programming:\n",
    "1. The value of an expression is independent of the order in which sub-expressions are evaluated\n",
    "2. Sub-expressions can be safely be valuated in parallel (if we have multiple processing units) or on demand (wait and see if we need the value of a sub-expression before evaluating it, a.k.a. lazily)\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 things above are the product of **referential transparency**, the idea that the value of an expression does not change when we substitute one of its subexpression with the value of that subexpression.\n",
    "* This allows us to do memoization without worrying that we're changing the behavior of our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many excitements with functional programming, especially nowadays that computers are having more processing units which make it more feasible to parallelize work automatically. \n",
