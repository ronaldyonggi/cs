    "Macros are a feature of Scheme that allows us to define new special forms in the language. In Python, we have a certain inventory of expressions and statement types. The same is true with Scheme, we had defined `lambda`, `if`, `con`, `and`, `or`, etc. Everything else is a procedure. \n",

    "Macros allow us to extend the inventory of expressions and statement types by inventing new kinds of special forms. This means we can change the way the language works, inventing new ways in which the flow of evaluation proceeds through a program.\n",
