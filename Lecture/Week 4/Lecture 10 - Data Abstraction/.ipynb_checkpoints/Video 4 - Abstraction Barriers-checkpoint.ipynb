    "# Abstraction Barriers\n",
    "Abstraction barriers separate different parts of a program so that each part only needs to know so much about the rest of the program. The separation is important since it allows us to make changes to one part of the program while the other parts take advantages of those changes without breaking the whole program or creating any inconsistencies. \n",

    "- In this case, we treat rationals as **whole data values**\n",
    "    - Rationals represent some numbers \n",
    "    - We don't care how, we just want to know what happens when we multiply the 2 numbers together.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- To do this, we use certain functions that are part of the data abstraction for rational numbers.\n",
    "    - `add_rational`\n",

    "    - `rationals_are_equal`\n",

    "- Obeys the abstraction that has been set up by the programmer\n",

    "    - The program doesn't need to know how the pairing happened, \n",
    "         - But it needs to know that a rational number has a numerator and a denominator, and they can be selected\n",

    "         \n",
