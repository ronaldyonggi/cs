    "    * This is a huge improvement since we don't need to look at points in bucket 13!\n",

    "Typical implementation would have the container itself compute a bucket number. That is:\n",
    "* Don't use the object's `hashCode()`\n",
    "* Instead, have each object provides `getX()` and `getY()`\n",

    "What is the runtime for `nearest` assuming points are evenly spread out?\n",

    "* On average, runtime is 16 times faster than without spatial partitioning, but N/16 is still $\\Theta(N)$\n",
