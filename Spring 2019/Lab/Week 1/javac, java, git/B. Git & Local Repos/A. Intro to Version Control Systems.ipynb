    "`Version control systems` are tools to **keep track of changes to files over time**. Version control allows us to view or revert back to previous iteration of files. Some aspects of version control are actually built into commonly used applciations. Think of the `undo` command or how we can see the revision history of a Google document.\n",

    "In the context of coding, version control can **track the history of code revisions, from the current state of the coe all the way back until it was first tracked**. This allows users to reference older versions of their work and share code changes with other people, like fellow developers."

    "Git is a [distributed version control system] as opposed to a centralized version control system. This means that **every developer's computer stores the entire history of the entire project!**. Unlike Dropbox, where old versions are stored on a remote server owned by someone else.\n",
