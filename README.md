# Data 8 Progress Tracker

This repository contains the progress of UC Berkeley Data 8 course materials that I have completed. All course materials licenses belong to UC Berkeley.

## Progress Table

The table below keeps track of the materials that I have / have not completed.
* The syllabus and lecture videos are based on the [Summer 2017](http://data8.org/su17/) course materials.
* The assignments (excluding projects) are based on [Fall 2016](http://data8.org/fa16/) course materials due to availability of solution manuals. 
* The projects are based on [Fall 2018](http://data8.org/fa18/) course materials (because Fall 2016 projects use out-of-date libraries). 
* The readings are based on the online textbook [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro) by [Ani Adhikari](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/ani-adhikari) and [John DeNero](http://denero.org/).


### Note:
The table below follows most of the syllabus of [Summer 2017](http://data8.org/su17/) course. However, it does not follow the course's **Reading** section because Summer 2017 course's readings were based on the older version of online textbook. Instead, the table lists the reading sections that are covered in the video lectures.
