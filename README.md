# Data 8 Progress Tracker - COMPLETED

This repository contains my progress with UC Berkeley Data 8 - The Foundations of Data Science. All course material licenses belong to UC Berkeley.

* Syllabus and lecture videos are based on the [Summer 2017](http://data8.org/su17/) course materials.
* Assignments (excluding projects) are based on [Fall 2016](http://data8.org/fa16/) course materials.
* Projects 1-3 are based on [Fall 2018](http://data8.org/fa18/) course materials. 
* Project 4: Independent Exploration that is based on [Fall 2017](http://data8.org/fa17/)
* Course reading is based on the online textbook [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro) by [Ani Adhikari](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/ani-adhikari) and [John DeNero](http://denero.org/).

Lecture notes are written in .ipynb files, which can be opened with Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
