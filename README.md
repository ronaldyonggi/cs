# Data 8 Progress Tracker

This repository contains the progress of UC Berkeley Data 8 course materials that I have completed. All course materials licenses belong to UC Berkeley.

## Progress Table

The table below keeps track of the materials that I have / have not completed.
* The syllabus and lecture videos are based on the [Summer 2017](http://data8.org/su17/) course materials.
* The assignments (excluding projects) are based on [Fall 2016](http://data8.org/fa16/) course materials due to availability of solution manuals. 
* The projects are based on [Fall 2018](http://data8.org/fa18/) course materials (because Fall 2016 projects use out-of-date libraries). 
* The readings are based on the online textbook [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro) by [Ani Adhikari](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/ani-adhikari) and [John DeNero](http://denero.org/).


### Note:
The table below follows most of the syllabus of [Summer 2017](http://data8.org/su17/) course. However, it does not follow the syllabus's **Reading** section because Summer 2017 course's readings were based on the older version of the online textbook. Instead, the table below lists the reading sections that are covered in the video lectures.
