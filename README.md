# Data 8 Progress Tracker

This repository contains the progress of UC Berkeley Data 8 course materials that I have completed. All course materials licenses belong to UC Berkeley.

## Progress Table

The table below keeps track of the materials that I have / have not completed.
* The syllabus and lecture videos are based on the [Summer 2017](http://data8.org/su17/) course materials.
* The assignments (excluding projects) are based on [Fall 2016](http://data8.org/fa16/) course materials due to availability of solution manuals. 
* The projects are based on [Fall 2018](http://data8.org/fa18/) course materials. 
* An additional Project 4: Independent Exploration that is based on [Fall 2017](http://data8.org/fa17/)
* The course reading is based on the online textbook [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro) by [Ani Adhikari](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/ani-adhikari) and [John DeNero](http://denero.org/).


### Note:
The course progress below does not include the syllabus's **Reading** section because the Summer 2017 course readings were based on the older version of the online textbook.
