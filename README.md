# Data 8 Progress Tracker

This repository contains the progress of UC Berkeley Data 8 course materials that I have completed. 

## Progress Table

The table below keeps track of the materials that I have / have not completed.
The syllabus and lecture videos are based on the [Summer 2017](http://data8.org/su17/) course materials.
The assignments (excluding projects, due to the projects utilizing out-of-date libraries) are based on Fall 2016 course materials. 
The projects are based on Fall 2018 course materials. 
The readings are based on the online textbook [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro) by [Ani Adhikari](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/ani-adhikari) and [John DeNero](http://denero.org/).

###Note:
The table below follows most of the syllabus of [Summer 2017](http://data8.org/su17/) course. However, it does not follow the course's **Reading** section because Summer 2017 course's readings were based on the older version of online textbook. Instead, the table lists the reading sections that are involved in the video lectures.
