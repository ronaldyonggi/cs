    "The structure shown will support fast `addLast` and `getLast` but not `removeLast` because if we remove the last element, we would need to find the \"2nd from last\" element to be assigned as the new last.\n",

    "Try to devise a scheme for speeding up `removeLast` operations so that it always runs in constant time, no matter how long the list. Don't worry about coding up a solution, we'll leave that to project 1. Just come up with an idea about how you'd modify the structure of the list (e.g. the instance variables).\n",
