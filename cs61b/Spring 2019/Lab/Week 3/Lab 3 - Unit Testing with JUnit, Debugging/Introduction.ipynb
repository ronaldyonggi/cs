Therefore, Unit Testing enforces good code structure (each code should only do \"One Thing\"), and allows us to consider all of the edge cases for each method and test them individually.\n",

Furthermore, if we have a terrible bug that's hard to fix, we can use `git` to revert back to a state when the code was working properly according to the JUnit tests."
