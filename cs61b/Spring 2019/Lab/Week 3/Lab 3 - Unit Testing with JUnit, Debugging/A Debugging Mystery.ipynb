    "Another important skill to learn is how to exhaustively debug. When done properly, debugging should allow us to rapidly narrow down where a bug might be located, even when we're debugging code we don't fully understand. Consider the scenario:\n",

    "* Our company, Flik Enterprises, has released a fine software library `Flik.java` that's able to determine whether 2 integers are the same or not.\n",
    "* We receive an email from \"Horrible Steve\" who describes a problem they're having with the company's library:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Dear Flik Enterprises,\n",

    "* Writing JUnit tests for the Flik library\n",
    "* Using the IntelliJ debugger, especially `conditional breakpoints` or `breaking on exceptions`\n",
    "    * Run -> View Breakpoints -> Check \"Java Exceptions Breakpoints\" -> Uncheck \"Caught Exceptions\"\n",
    "* Using print statements\n",
    "* Refactoring Horrible Steve's code.\n",
    "    * Refactoring means changing the syntax without changing the functionality.\n",
    "    * This may be difficult to do since HS's code uses lots of weird stuff\n",
